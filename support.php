    <section class="about">
        <p>
        Street Tithers is a non-governmental and non-profit and non-denominational humanitarian 
        aid organization with emphasis on love for humanity and being your brother’s keeper, 
        using our 10% of our income or less, as stated in the holy book Malachi 3:10-11. "Bring 
        ye all the Tithes into the Storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me 
        now herewith, said the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and 
        pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke
        the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, neither shall 
        your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts." The holy book 
        also says in the book of 1 Corinthians 6:19 that “your body is the temple of the lord” Also 
        Ephesians 3:17 says: “That I may make my home in you”. Thus, every human is the house (Temple) 
        of the lord, and tithing into people's lives anywhere is not just beautiful a thing to do but 
        also living the words. Instead of paying your Tithe in the Church, we introduce what we call 
        'Street Tithing'; paying your Tithes on the street or part of your Tithes, towards the cause of 
        the less- privileged in the society on the street; towards healing the world and alleviating 
        poverty in communities around the world. We provide a platform for you to reach out to the poor 
        and under privileged in the society through Tithing'.
